			<div class="responsiveContainer1">	
				<div class="content">
					<div class="text60">
					<p>People want to start working out to improve their physical health, and a workout partner can help with this by holding you accountable. However, some struggle to find compatible individuals
					to workout with.</p>

			<h1 style="text-align: center;">BENEFITS</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>Working out with a partner has numerous benefits. It helps you...</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Be more consistent. When someone else is counting on you to show up, you won’t want to let them down.</li>
				<li>Feel more motivated. When you and your buddy encourage each other, you’ll work harder (and get better results!). And there’s nothing wrong with a little friendly competition.</li>
				<li>Makes exercise feel less like a chore, and more like a fun hobby</li>
				<li>Be more adventurous. It’s easier to try new things with a buddy. You may just find an activity you love, one that feels more like fun and less like a workout.</li>
			</ol>

					<div class="text60">
						<p>"Franco Columbu was my training partner. So whenever people say 'how can I be successful in lifting/body-building' I always told them that I 100% believe in a training partner. Because
						a training partner is helping you when you're down and the other person is up, so Franco was pushing me when I was down, I was pushing him when he was down."</p>
